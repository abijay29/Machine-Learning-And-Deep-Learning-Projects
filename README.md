# My Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple projects in **image processing, NLP, TTS, and sentiment analysis**.  
Each project folder contains code and a README describing its details.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Denoising_SuperResolution
Goal: Develop deep learning models capable of denoising and performing **4x super-resolution** on low-light images.  
Objective: Produce high-quality outputs that are visually appealing and rich in detail.

### 2. Depth_Estimation
Goal: Predict depth from RGB images corrupted with degradations.  
Objective: Advance depth estimation in **challenging real-world scenarios**.

### 3. Object_Detection
Project: Low-Light Object Detection and Classification of Mosquitoes.  
Objective: Automate mosquito identification using ML/DL, enabling efficient detection to prevent disease outbreaks like Dengue and Zika.

### 4. IndicTTS_
Challenge: Detect AI-generated speech across **16 Indian languages**.  
Objective: Develop models predicting whether audio is synthesized. Performance measured with **ROC-AUC score**.

### 5. Image_Classification
Course Project (Deep Learning Practice - DLP)  
Objective: Classify images from flora and fauna datasets using robust deep learning models.

### 6. Multilingual_Sentiment_Analysis
Goal: Classify sentiment in text across **13 Indian languages** into Positive or Negative.  
Method: Use **LLaMA 3.1-8B-Instruct** model with LoRA fine-tuning.  
Evaluation: F1 Score on Kaggle Notebook submissions.

### 7. Sentiment_Prediction_MovieReviews
Dataset: Movie-review pairs including title, description, genres, director, actors, ratings, and review text.  
Objective: Build ML models to predict **sentiment of review text**.
