## Yolo model for object detection

## Overview
I have used a pre-trained YOLO model (yolov8m.pt) on a Mosquito object detection dataset. The model is optimized using AdamW and evaluated based on mean average precision (mAP).


## Training Details

- Optimizer: AdamW
- Learning Rate: 0.0005
- Weight Decay: 0.0005
- Batch Size: 16
- Image Size: 512x512
- Epochs: 50
- Patience: 5 (Early stopping if no improvement)
-Augmentations:
        Flip Left-Right: 50%
        Mosaic Augmentation: 80%
        Mixup Augmentation: 10%
        Copy-Paste Augmentation: 10%
- Number of Workers: 4
- Caching: Enabled (for faster training)
- Device: CUDA (GPU)
- Best model is saved based on mean average precision (mAP).

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies (if not installed)
2. Import necessary libraries   
3. Run the notebook in a GPU environment with accelerator set to T4 * 2.
4. Run all cells sequentially (install dependencies → load data → train model → evaluate →  predict test data).
5.Submission file (21f3000728.csv) will be generated.
6.Submit to the competition
